Each part is taken as a separate 100 question exam, and you will have 3.5 hours to answer all questions for that part. The IRS Special Enrollment Exam (SEE) is the easiest of the exams that give you unlimited representation rights to practice before the IRS.The other two are the CPA exam and the Bar exam, both of which have significant educational requirements which must be met before you can sit for the test. That does not mean the EA exam is easy. An enrolled agent, to be considered a tax expert, must “demonstrate special competence in tax matters” by passing three separate exams to become an enrolled agent. Difficulty depends on experience, but the credential is attainable for those willing to put in the effort."
